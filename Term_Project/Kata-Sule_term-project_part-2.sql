-- TERM PROJECT PART II.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------
-- This SQL script contains the second part of the Term Project created by Kata SÃ¼le for the Data Engineering 1 course.
-- The second part consists of the analytics plan, the creation of the analytical layer, the ETL pipeline and the data marts.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------
-- ANALYTICS PLAN
-- ---------------------------------------------------------
-- The aim of the analytics is to find out how the counts of rental times vary when focusing on the different aspects of movies 
-- the DVD rental company has in its inventory. One of these aspects is the original language and whether the preferences of people differ
-- in different countries when it comes to watching movies in their original languages, while the other aspect is the category and
-- determining which categories are most popular among customers in general.

-- Consequently the structure of the data store is as follows:
-- Fact: Count of Rental Times
-- Dimension 1: Language, Original Language
-- Dimension 2: Category
-- Dimension 3: Country of Store
-- Dimension 4: Population of Country

-- Using the created data store two data marts are created with the help of views. The questions they aim to answer are the
-- following: 
-- View 1:
-- Is the per capita ratio of renting non-dubbed movies higher in Canada than in Australia?
-- View 2:
-- Have customers rented more comedies than action movies?

-- ---------------------------------------------------------
-- CREATING THE ANALYTICAL LAYER AND THE ETL PIPELINE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------
USE dvd_rental;

-- Creating a stored procedure to join necessary tables and return with the analytical layer as a new table called 'datastore'.

-- CREATING THE DATA MARTS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------
-- The two data marts are created with the help of views.

-- Data Mart 1. : Is the per capita ratio of renting non-dubbed movies higher in Canada than in Australia?
-- The language_id column indicates the language into which the movie was dubbed, consequently if a value in this column
-- is the same as in the original_language_id column then the movie was not dubbed.

SELECT film_id, language_id, original_language_id, rental_id, country, population FROM datastore
WHERE country IN('Canada', 'Australia') AND language_id = original_language_id;

-- With the help of this view it is possible to answer the first question of the analytics.
SELECT country, COUNT(rental_id)/population AS rented_per_capita
FROM Orig_Lang
GROUP BY country;
-- Based on the rented_per_capita value we can say that customers in Australia watched more movies in their original language, however the 
-- difference from Canada is very small.

-- Data Mart 2. : Have customers rented more comedies than action movies?
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS Comedy_vs_Action;

CREATE VIEW `Comedy_vs_Action` AS
SELECT film_id, category, rental_id FROM datastore
WHERE category IN('Comedy', 'Action');

-- With the help of this view it is possible to answer the second question of the analytics.
SELECT category, COUNT(rental_id) AS number_of_rentals
FROM Comedy_vs_Action
GROUP BY category;
-- We can conclude that customers have rented more action movies (1112) than comedies (941).
